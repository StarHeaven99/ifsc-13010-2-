                <h2> Who is he </h2>
                <p> <strong> Diavolo (ディアボロ Diaboro) is the main antagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo. </strong> 
                    The first boss of <em> Passione </em>, Diavolo seeks absolute security and superiority by eliminating all traces of his past, including his daughter, Trish Una, and attempts to retrieve her via manipulating Team Bucciarati through his orders. 
                    He and Vinegar Doppio are two souls inhabiting a single body, and while Doppio can only partially manifest the incredibly deadly King Crimson, Diavolo is the Stand's primary User and wields its brutal power in full.
                    
                    
                    </p>

                    <h2> Apperance </h2>
                    <p> Diavolo is a tall man with a lean and semi-muscular build. He has long hair, <strong>leopard-patterned with various spots, parted in a zig-zagging manner</strong>; the bangs of which are propped and parted slightly to the side. 
                        The rest of his hair is cut straight across at his shoulders. His shirt, hidden under <em>Doppio's sweater </em>, appears to be made of complex mesh-wiring: it covers his shoulders and torso but down his back and abdomen are linked circles that are tucked under his belt, which in the back end in two~three long "coat tails". 
                        On his arms are floral sleeve tattoos leading down to a pair of gold wristbands. He also shares a pair of studded pants and seemingly sock-less loafers with Doppio.</p>

                        <h3> Personality </h3> 
                        <p> The <em> biggest </em> personality trait Diavolo shows is his <strong> obsession with erasing any trace of his history and keeping his presence a secret from the world </strong>, a compulsion he tries to fulfill by any means.
                             As he believes the mistakes of the past or simply the past itself is something to be defeated and destroyed in order for human beings to grow, he is exceptionally anxious about his past, linking it to fear, and being apprehensive of anyone learning of him. Even in the already secretive Passione hierarchy, 
                            Diavolo goes to excessive length to hide his identity and his face, issuing orders through several proxies or by computer so that nobody ever meets him personally.</p>

                            <h4> History: Early Life </h4>
                            <p> While a majority of Diavolo's background is <em> vague </em>, some facts are made clear: <strong> born in an all-female prison during the summer of 1967, his mother claimed she had been pregnant for two years and there was no father </strong>, both within the jail and outside, that could've fathered her child. Because she still had years on her sentence, Diavolo was sent back to Sardinia to live with the priest in his mother's hometown. 
                                According to neighbors and friends, Diavolo was frank, yet timid and not too bright; he had also desired to be a sailor rather than a priest like his father wanted him to be. At some point Diavolo met his mother and buried her beneath his house.</p>

                                <h5> Abilities </h5>

                                <p> Diavolo's Stand is King Crimson, <strong> an extremely powerful Stand with tremendous physical strength and the ability to erase time up to a 10 seconds time frame as well as predict anything that happens over the following 10 seconds. </strong>
                                    Although it has some limitations, King Crimson renders him essentially <em> invincible</em> in a fight as he can either foresee and counter the enemy's actions or render them meaningless by erasing the timeframe in which they happen. He is known for his:</p>

Eternal greatness exists only within myself. <cite>Diavolo.</cite></blockqoute> Epitaph (エピタフ (墓碑銘) Epitafu) is a sub-Stand ability that acts as a complement to King Crimson's primary ability of time erasure. Diavolo and Doppio often use the forecasting ability of Epitaph to predict any incoming threat, making sneak attacks ineffective against them. </dt>
